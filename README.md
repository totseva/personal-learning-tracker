Ideas Behind the Project
->The Frontend Learning Tracker was designed with a few goals in mind:

1. Organize learning visually
- Instead of a long list of notes, the tracker breaks concepts into digestible cards.
- Filtering by category helps focus on one topic at a time.
- Encourage progress tracking
- Status badges (Done, Learning, Not started) make it easy to see where you are and what’s next.

2. Friendly and modern UX
- Soft colors, subtle hover effects, and rounded cards make the app feel approachable, reducing “learning fatigue”.
- Sticky sidebar ensures navigation is never lost, even on long pages.

3. Flexibility for beginners
- Built entirely with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript — no frameworks required.
- Easy to extend with new cards, categories, or features.
